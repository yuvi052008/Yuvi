      <p>
        Monkey D. Luffy, commonly known as "Straw Hat Luffy" or simply "Straw
        Hat", is the founder, captain, and strongest combatant of the
        increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates. He fearlessly
        pursues the legendary treasure of the late Gol D. Roger in order to
        become the new Pirate King, and reach a further, untold dream (currently
        known to only his crew and closest friends). He eves that being the
        Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world. Born on Dawn
        Island, Luffy is the son of Revolutionary leader Monkey D. Dragon
        grandson of the Marine hero Monkey D. Garp, and as such a carrier of the
        mysterious "D" legacy. Most of his childhood was shaped by Garp and
        Curly Dadan, under whose care he befriended and swore brotherhood to the
        late Portgas D. "Fire Fist" Ace and Revolutionary officer Sabo. However,
        he draws his greatest inspiration from the pirate "Red-Haired" Shanks,
        who (unwittingly) enabled him to eat the Devil Fruit that turned his
        body into rubber, sacrificed an arm to save his life, and gifted his
        signature straw hat as a symbol of their vow to reunite someday, after
        Luffy became a great pirate.As a pirate, Luffy has actively opposed
        countless regional, national, and global powers, beginning with several
        established East Blue pirates and extending to the Marines, the Seven
        Warlords of the Sea, Cipher Pol, the World Nobles, and even the Four
        Emperors of the New World. Despite his young age and relatively short
        career, he has triumphed over a majority of these, successfully invading
        and indirectly causing the annihilation of Enies Lobby, escaping the
        impregnable Impel Down, enabling several key developments in the Summit
        War of Marineford, and defeating three Warlords and an Emperor in direct
        combat. At the same time, he carries a great penchant for attracting
        friends and allies; in addition to personally engaging every member of
        his crew, he has earned regard and gratitude among many nations, fellow
        pirates, the Revolutionary Army, and even several Marines.Luffy has
        gained wide infamy through his accomplishments, heritage, and general
        recklessness, drawing many large bounties as well as the focused
        hostility of the World Government, Marine Headquarters, and Fleet
        Admiral Sakazuki in particular. Currently, he is recognized as a central
        member of the Worst Generation,[40] the unwilling leader of the
        seven-crew Straw Hat Grand Fleet, and—in wake of defeating Kaidou during
        the Raid on Onigashima—one of the Four Emperors, with a bounty of
        3,000,000,000.He is the main protagonist of the manga and anime, One
        Piece.

      <p>
        Zoro is a tall, muscular man with lightly tanned skin. He always carries
        his three swords along with him, bundled up with a green haramaki over
        his right hip, allowing him to easily draw them with his left hand. Of
        the three swords he has on his person, he has always been seen carrying
        the Wado Ichimonji, while his other two swords have varied over time due
        to them being destroyed and subsequently replaced with progressively
        better ones. Although his right hand is usually seen resting over them,
        he can also use this hand to pull his swords out before sitting down. He
        has three identical gold earrings on his left earlobe. Zoro normally
        keeps a black bandana tied around his left bicep and ties it around his
        head when he is fighting seriously against an opponent. Zoro's body is
        covered with scars from his many battles, most notably the massive scar
        stretching from his left shoulder to his right hip that he acquired
        during his loss against the world's greatest swordsman, Dracule Mihawk,
        at Baratie. His other visible scars are the scars he inflicted upon his
        ankles in a desperate attempt to free himself from Mr. 3's Tokudai
        Candle Service Set by trying to cut his feet off at Little Garden. After
        the timeskip, he gained another scar over his left eye, obtained through
        unknown means. Zoro gained his first bounty of 60,000,000 berries after
        the Arabasta Arc. It later increased to 120,000,000 berries after the
        Enies Lobby incident, then again to 320,000,000 berries after the
        Dressrosa Arc. Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was
        increased to 1,111,000,000 berries

      <div data-aos="zoom-in-right" id="lp" class="fps"><h2>SANJI</h2></div>
      <p>
        Sanji is a tall, slim, muscular man with long legs and blond hair which
        he keeps brushed over one side of his face. Before the timeskip, this
        was the left side. After the two-year timeskip, he switched his
        hairstyle so that it covers the right side. It also appears that Sanji's
        hair is less straight and scruffier after the timeskip. Among Sanji's
        physical traits are his distinctive eyebrows. Both form a spiral but at
        different ends. His right eyebrow forms a spiral at the outer end, while
        his left eyebrow forms a spiral at the inner end. His eyebrows curl in
        the opposite direction from his siblings, whose eyebrows curl in a
        counterclockwise direction (i.e., to the left side). Sanji's eyebrows
        instead curl in a clockwise direction (i.e., to the right side). During
        his battle with Queen, when his dormant genetic modifications awakened,
        Sanji's eyebrows switched to curling in the same direction as his
        siblings' (i.e., to the left side).After being unconscious for a brief
        period , when he awoke, his eyebrows had returned to their original
        shape.When fighting S-Shark, his eyebrows changed direction again,
        although they reverted back following the battle. After
        deflecting Kizaru's laser with a kick, his eyebrows have once again
        changed directions. While Sanji's eyes usually seem black, he was
        depicted with grey-blue eyes in the anime at the beginning of Thriller
        Bark Arc.This is shown again during the Punk Hazard Arc, when Trafalgar
        Law switched Sanji into Nami's body, and her usual brown eyes became
        grey blue in color. He first gained a bounty of 77,000,000 for his role
        in the raid on Enies Lobby. It increased to 177,000,000 after the
        Dressrosa Arc, but the condition of his bounty was changed to Only Alive
        due to his biological father's interference. After he escaped from Big
        Mom's territory, his bounty condition was reverted back to Dead or Alive
        (with the Vinsmoke name despite his renouncing it), and its value
        increased to 330,000,000. Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty
        was increased to 1,032,000,000.

        Arlong Pirates and initially joined the Straw Hats so that she could rob
        them in order to buy back her village from Arlong. However, she
        legitimately joined the Straw Hats after they rebelled against and
        defeated Arlong. Her dream is to make a map of the entire world.She

        archaeologists, Robin is the daughter of Nico Olvia. Robin ate the Hana
        Hana no Mi at a young age, giving her the power to reproduce her body
        parts (or her entire body) on any surface at will. As the sole survivor
        of the destroyed West Blue island Ohara, she is currently one of only
        two people in the world known to have the ability to read and decipher
        Poneglyphs, a skill which is considered forbidden and threatening to the
        World Government. She acted as the vice president of Baroque Works as
        "Miss All Sunday", serving and partnering herself directly with the
        organization's president; the ex-Warlord: Crocodile, who operated under
        the codename "Mr. 0". She was a secondary antagonist of the Arabasta
        Saga, before joining the Straw Hats. Her dream is to find the Rio
        Poneglyph which tells the true history of the world, specifically the
        Void Century. She gained a bounty of 79,000,000 at the age of 8 due to
        her ability to read poneglyphs after the destruction of Ohara. It later
        increased to 80,000,000 after the Straw Hats invaded Enies Lobby to
        rescue her and escape. After the Dressrosa Arc, it was increased to
        130,000,000. Following the Raid on Onigashima, her bounty was increased
        to 930,000,000.

        "Soul King" Brook is the musician of the Straw Hat Pirates, one of their
        two swordsmen, and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand
        Fleet. He is the ninth member of the crew and the eighth to join, doing
        so at the end of the Thriller Bark Arc. Brook ate the Yomi Yomi no Mi,
        which allowed him to return to life after death once. Brook eventually
        learned to tap deeper into the powers of his Devil Fruit, giving him
        significant control over his own soul and the souls of others.Originally
        a member of the Rumbar Pirates, he died and was resurrected through the
        power of the Yomi Yomi no Mi. However, due to the amount of time it took
        for his soul to find his body, it was reduced to a skeleton, keeping
        only his afro intact. Brook drifted alone in the Florian Triangle for 50
        years, eventually meeting Luffy and serving as the Straw Hats' ally
        during the Thriller Bark Arc before officially joining the crew. His
        dream is to reunite with his old friend, Laboon, at Reverse Mountain,
        where he resides with Crocus.He first gained a bounty of 33,000,000
        during his time as a member of the Rumbar Pirates. It later increased to

        Post-Enies Lobby Arc. Born "Cutty Flam", he chose to go by his nickname
        of "Franky" until eventually permanently discarding his true name per
        the request of Iceburg to hide his identity. Originally from the South
        Blue, Franky was abandoned by his family as a four-year-old, eventually
        making his way to Water 7. There, he came to be a member of Tom's
        Workers, until an incident resulted in his body being heavily damaged
        and requiring him to augment himself into a cyborg. Upon returning to
        Water 7, he became the leader of the Franky Family, a group of ship
        dismantlers and bounty hunters. Franky and his followers were originally
        enemies of the Straw Hats at the beginning of the Water 7 Arc, until
        circumstances forced them to become allies at the end of the same arc
        and the Enies Lobby Arc. Franky's dream is to create a ship and
        circumnavigate the world with it, and he built the Thousand Sunny and
        joined the Straw Hat Pirates to fulfill his dream. He gained a bounty of
        44,000,000 for his involvement at the Enies Lobby Incident. It later
        increased to 94,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc. Following the Raid on

        Fish-Man Karate. His dream is to fulfill his former captain Fisherf
        Tiger's dying wish of coexistence and equality between humans and
        fish-men. He was a member of the Sun Pirates, eventually becoming its
        second captain after the death of their original captain, Tiger. He
        eventually became one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, though he
        resigned during the Summit War of Marineford. Vegapunk later cloned
        Jinbe as one of the Seraphim, S-Shark, to replace the Warlords. Prior to
        and amidst said war, Jinbe befriended Monkey D. Luffy, and two years
        later allied with him and his crew to prevent the New Fish-Man Pirates'
        coup d'état against the Ryugu Kingdom's Neptune Royal Family. Luffy
        thereafter invited him to join the Straw Hat Pirates, but Jinbe held it
        off until severing ties with Big Mom during the Whole Cake Island Arc.

        new captain of the Sun Pirates before it was frozen after he joined the
        Seven Warlords. Upon resigning his position as a Warlord at the Summit
        War of Marineford, his bounty was reinstated at 438,000,000. Following
